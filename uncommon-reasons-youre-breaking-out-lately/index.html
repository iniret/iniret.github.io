    <div class="mt-10 max-w-2xl prose md:pr-20">
      <html><head></head><body><p>Suffering an unexpected facial breakout is one of the frustrating things to deal with, especially if you don’t have a clue for any reasons you’re breaking out to begin with. It’s quite normal for anyone to breakout due to hormone changes. Estrogen fluctuates a good bit from the time we hit puberty until we hit the menopause which can be a big reason women suffer breakouts. However, our hormones aren’t the only thing to blame. If you’re having unexpected facial issues, some of these uncommon reasons you’re breaking out might be the culprit. Best of all, these pesky reasons come with an easy fix to have you looking fabulous again in no time! </p><h2 id="1">1. Acidic Foods</h2> <p>Acidic foods in your diet is probably one of the most influential reasons you’re breaking out, believe it or not. Chocolate isn’t always the one to blame either, if you’re wondering! Acidic foods that contribute to breakouts most of the time include sugar, refined starches, acidic produce items like tomatoes, oranges, grapefruit, and strawberries. Though produce items are healthy for you, some people’s skin does not react well to the acid in those foods, and eating just one serving can cause a breakout or two. Lemons and limes are two acidic foods that actually turn alkaline inside the body, and can help clear acne, so don’t worry about these. Sugar and refined starches should be eliminated from your diet as soon as possible. </p><h2 id="2">2. Wheat</h2> <p>Many people are sensitive to wheat, and don’t even know it. Even if you’re not gluten-intolerant, you can still be sensitive to wheat products. I used to eat low carb protein bars that contained wheat, and my face was always a mess. Eliminating the wheat in my diet not only gave me more energy, but also cleared up my skin. Wheat has a hard time being efficiently broken down in the digestive tract. When digestion can’t be fully completed and nutrients can’t be completely absorbed as they should, your face often will breakout due to compromised digestion and undigested nutrients in the blood stream. Wheat is also highly acidic as well. Choose oats, quinoa, brown rice or any gluten-free product that’s whole grain, unrefined, and low in sugar. </p><h2 id="3">3. Not Enough Fat</h2> <p>Believe it or not, a low fat diet can actually give you acne. Too much fat isn’t the answer though. Try having small servings of healthy fats throughout the day. These include anti-inflammatory sources like walnuts, almonds, flax, hemp, chia, avocado, olives, fish, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and coconut products in their raw form. These foods are actually potent anti-acne fighters as well, and will help combat acne you may currently have. Olive, hemp, and flax oil are also fine, but do be sure to use them in moderate portions, with no more than 2 tbsp. per day. Oils can be healthy if cold pressed, but shouldn’t be over consumed since they aren’t a complete whole food. </p><h2 id="4">4. Whey Protein</h2> <p>I think an organic, cold-processed whey protein can be a good option for athletes who don’t like vegan protein sources, but I will say that whey protein is often a huge contributor to acne, and most people don’t know it. Whey protein is very acidic, even though it is great for your body’s amino acid needs. Because it is so processed, and it is from dairy, it can cause inflammation in the skin. If you’ve tried everything else, and still can’t clear your acne while consuming whey protein, try eliminating it for one week and see if things help. A great alternative is hemp protein, which has all essential amino acids, along with natural nutrients that fight acne. I also like Vega One Nutritional Shake, as well as Sunwarrior Warrior Blend Raw plant protein. </p><h2 id="5">5. Your Moisturizer</h2> <p>Outside of food causes for your breakouts, have you ever considered it might just be your moisturizer? I find that many, many moisturizing products break me out, and even ones that other people say helps their breakouts. I find any oils like coconut oil break my skin out, along with most commercial moisturizers on the market, even if they are oil-free and of the highest quality. What I have found to work for me is a strange, but amazing answer. I use Neutrogena Age Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen, which contains natural moisturizers, sunscreen and a special technology by Neutrogena that actually improves acne, wrinkles, and fights dryness. I have never had prettier skin since using this product, even after eating an incredibly clean diet. If you think your moisturizer might be to blame, I highly suggest trying the Ultra Sheer Sunscreen line by Neutrogena, or the Age Defense product I mentioned. </p><h2 id="6">6. Too Much Caffeine</h2> <p>How’s your caffeine intake lately? I know you might not think those extra javas, energy drinks, stimulants ( which I hope you’re not taking anyway), black teas, and other caffeine products are the reasons for your breakouts, but they very likely could be. Even if they don’t have sugar in them ( which will break you out), they all still stimulate your adrenals to work overtime, along with your hormones. Too much caffeine alters your estrogen levels, which can be the reason, and excess cortisol is pumped out in the body to deal with internal stress. This creates havoc on your skin, and most people don’t even realize it. Lower your caffeine sources, or switch to decaf. Better yet, have that boring cup of water with lemon you hear so much about. It really does clear your skin and gives you a wonderful energy boost. </p><h2 id="7">7. Your Schedule is on Overload</h2> <p>If you’re constantly on the go and can’t seem to catch a break anywhere you turn, it’s more than likely the reason for your acne. Stress from a busy schedule can really do a number on your skin. It makes you tired, puts your hormones into overload, and it can also cause you to choose poor lifestyle habits like no exercise, poor eating, and getting less sleep. These lifestyle factors all greatly alter your hormones, which in turn, create acne. Clear your schedule however possible to get some downtime. Your face will thank you for it! </p><h2 id="8">8. Lots of Fruit in Your Diet</h2> <p>First, before anyone gets upset, let’s just say that fruit is a very healthy food, and a much better alternative to sugar. However, if you’re sensitive to carbs in any way, a large amount of fruit in your diet will cause acne. I adore fruit, but I find when I eat it, I almost always breakout due to the excess sugar in my diet. The best choice? Berries, lemons, avocados, and cucumbers. All these fruits will help clear your skin and are all very low in sugar. </p><h2 id="9">9. Your Makeup Brushes</h2> <p>You’ve probably already thought about your makeup being a possible cause for your recent breakouts, but have you considered your makeup brushes? Makeup brushes that aren't washed regularly can be a large contributor to breakouts. The best thing to do to remove bacteria buildup is to let your brushes soak in a large cup of hot water with baby shampoo ( or regular shampoo), overnight. In the morning, wash them out really well and rub them with a paper towel vigorously to make sure they are dry. Keep drying them with a paper towel as much as possible for a minute or two, and then let them air dry for about 30 minutes. You can also use your hairdryer to dry them if you’re in a hurry, or let them sit in the sun. Do this once a month and make it a part of your beauty routine, just like anything else.  </p><p>If you have a breakout, and don’t know why, some of these uncommon reasons could be the answer.
