    <div class="mt-10 max-w-2xl prose md:pr-20">
      <html><head></head><body><p>Because 3,500 calories equals about 1 pound of fat, you need to burn 3,500 calories more than you take in to lose 1 pound. So, in general, if you cut 500 calories from your typical diet each day, you'd lose about 1 pound a week. And with simple changes you can do this without feeling deprived. Simple changes like adding an exercise session each day, making better food choices, using your body as means of transportation and even eliminating your late night snack can help you to cut 500 calories a day and lose your one pound goal weekly. Small changes add up to make a big difference so check out these easy ways to cut 500 calories daily! </p><h2 id="1">1.

Park Farther Away</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/g7/dp/fluwjvku5864a616cc1b2543232986_600x600.jpg" alt="human action, clothing, human positions, beauty, sitting," class="aligncenter size-full"> Park farther away from your destination instead of driving around looking for the closest spot. Speed walk to your destination and feel a little burn in the process. This simple change can yield some slimming and sculpting in the process. </p><h2 id="4">4. Run to Your Destinations</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/sh/ks/weh439lt5864a4f0a9127555937778_600x600.jpg" alt="human action, person, jogging, sports, running," class="aligncenter size-full"> If you are going somewhere local and do not need to use your car; walk, run or bike to your destination. Save on gas, save your waistline and save your life. You will better your heart and even have more energy when you arrive at your destination because you made the better choice for your life! It is all about a lifestyle change, not just a short phase of dieting in your life. </p><h2 id="5">5. Give up Your Sugar Drink</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/vj/lo/qs6519965864a5247735b008421328_500x495.jpg" alt="human action, leisure, image, clothing, person," class="aligncenter size-full"> Giving up just one sugary drink per day can yield a 10 pound weight loss per year; so ditch that unnecessary sugar load and beat the bulge. This simple change will not only help you to cut calories but also avoid that afternoon sugar crash you have been experience. And then you are winning with more energy! </p><h2 id="6">6. Nix Your Late Night Snack</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/z0/qo/vcpzvmif5864a643cbb0a328864133_540x540.jpg" alt="human action, hair, clothing, structure, active undergarment," class="aligncenter size-full"> We all love the occasional late night snack, but could your snack be ruining your diet? Absolutely! This is especially the case if you are on a ritual of eating late night on a daily basis. So ditch this snack which is contributing 300-500 calories daily and get to bed sleepy head. Your waistline will thank you tomorrow as you are able to comfortably button up your skinny jeans! </p><h2 id="7">7. Eat More Protein Throughout the Day</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/y6/e8/zqvixka45864a6f3cf496600954122_500x500.jpg" alt="dish, food, salad, produce, plant," class="aligncenter size-full"> Eating more protein throughout the day can help you to feel less hungry, rebuild your muscle fiber and even boost your metabolism. So start your day with eggs, snack on Greek yogurt, have a handful of nuts and enjoy some veggies and quinoa. Every little bit adds up to help you cut 500 calories daily! </p><h2 id="8">8. Get Fidgety</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/jr/p4/s0fev6q258663f5b36468331204242_600x600.jpg" alt="hair, clothing, image, swimwear, beauty," class="aligncenter size-full"> The science behind this is called NEAT, or non-exercise activity thermogenesis. The idea is that you can burn calories without formal exercise. That includes just getting your body moving all day long. Tap your toes, pace while you talk on the phone, or tap your desk with your hands while your thinking or sitting on hold. These tiny movements to your day can add up to hundreds of extra burned calories without ever having to find time to get to the gym. </p><h2 id="9">9. Stop Eating Nuts</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/wr/iy/pflhl6nb58663f9549d22198703144_500x500.jpg" alt="food, dish, produce, hazelnut, breakfast," class="aligncenter size-full"> OK, you can have a few nuts, but the truth is that they are very high in calories, despite their many health benefits. Because they get so much press as a health food, many women feel like they are a free for all. A handful of nuts easily contains close to 200 calories so sticking with one serving each day can save you a ton of calories. </p><h2 id="10">10. Quit Eating in Front of the Tv</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/cq/p4/mafxy4kc58663fc8161f3627280388_600x600.jpg" alt="active undergarment, clothing, undergarment, underpants, muscle," class="aligncenter size-full"> Sitting down in front of Netflix after a long day is a guilty pleasure you don't have to give up. Just stop eating while you indulge. When you are focused on your favorite show, you could find yourself shoveling in more food than you think, which makes it super easy to underestimate how much you're eating. Have dinner at the table and you'll be better able to focus on how much you consume, saving you loads of calories. </p><h2 id="11">11. Watch the Salad Ingredients</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/h5/y6/cinpwu5k58663ff1acc1d508410245_400x500.jpg" alt="salad, dish, food, produce, vegetable," class="aligncenter size-full"> Yes, a salad is a great meal choice when you're watching calories, but only if you do it the right way. Your salad should mainly be vegetables and lean protein. Other toppings can result in a salad that has more calories than a cheeseburger. Go easy on the cheese, cold cuts, nuts, bacon, avocado, dried fruit and croutons, suggest the experts at Health magazine. </p><h2 id="12">12. Measure Your Portions</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/b1/vh/e2d5mtjs58664004a9bff046789847_400x500.jpg" alt="food, dish, produce, vegetable, cuisine," class="aligncenter size-full"> Many women have a hard time eyeballing portion size, which makes it very easy to to eat more than you should. If you want to cut major calories from your diet, use measuring cups and a kitchen scale to make sure you are sticking with one serving of foods that can do you in, such as potato chips or chocolate. Once you have a better idea of what a serving looks like, you can manage how much you eat. </p><h2 id="13">13. Beware of the Smoothie</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/qk/ci/kdzvj7tx58664032f00d1017304302_500x500.jpg" alt="clothing, beauty, sunglasses, glasses, spring," class="aligncenter size-full"> You might think that opting for a smoothie is a better choice than the soda or energy drink. That could be true, but many smoothies contain even more sugar, calories and fat than the usual offenders. Done correctly, a smoothie can load you up on fiber, helping you feel full for longer. However, you've got to make it the right way, which means staying away from the juice bar. A simple combination or fruit, Greek yogurt and skim milk is low in sugar, but high in nutrition. By overhauling your smoothie you can save hundreds, if not thousands of calories at a time. </p><h2 id="14">14. Don't Be a Member of the Clean Plate Club</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/ym/kc/a4m5l00u5866404c08a56344575298_400x482.jpg" alt="human action, dish, eating, food, organ," class="aligncenter size-full"> There is absolutely no reason why you have to feel guilty about leaving a little bit of food behind on your plate. If you feel full, stop eating. You can save what's left for another meal. When you feel like you have to eat everything on your plate, you could be taking in more calories than you really need. By stopping when your body tells you too, you can easily save tons of calories on a daily basis. </p><h2 id="15">15. Get More Sleep</h2> <p><img src="https://img.allw.mn/content/ky/uq/vwpvuw2y5866407f35b38096019759_600x749.jpg" alt="footwear, human positions, leg, shoe, spring," class="aligncenter size-full"> If you sacrifice sleep to get just one more thing done, you could be doing yourself a huge disservice. Lack of sleep increases your hunger hormones, leading to overeating the next day. By getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night, you can effectively regulate your appetite and prevent yourself from taking in calories that you don't need.  </p><p>So with these easy changes are you ready to lose one pound weekly? Then take these small steps that will transform your health and your life for the better. It is time for you to reclaim your life! </p></body></html>
