      <html><head></head><body><p>Most of us know that if we don’t get enough sleep, we’re bound to be dragging the next day, but if you’re clocking 8 or 9 hours each night of slumber and still finding yourself dragging day after day, it’s time to consider some other reasons you might be tired all the time. There are often many hidden reasons why people are tired. Sure, caffeine withdrawal can make you sleepy, and stress can zonk your energy levels, yet there are plenty of other reasons you might be tired that you may not have considered. To find out a little more about what these reasons are and how to find out if they’re affecting you, read my top 7 reasons why most people are so tired all the time and have no idea why. </p><h2 id="1">1. Hypothyroidism</h2> <p>Low thyroid activity, also known as hypothyroidism, is one of the top things to consider among the reasons you might be tired all the time. All different types of things can cause hypothyroidism, such as chronic stress, certain food reactions, an autoimmune disorder, a pituitary gland disorder, a disorder of the hypothalamus and even pregnancy, which can cause your thyroid to function poorly. Your thyroid hormones are known as T3 and T4 and a simple test can indicate whether they are working properly or not, so ask your healthcare provider to test your thyroid if this is a concern. Typical symptoms include constant fatigue, joint pain, foggy thinking, extreme fatigue after eating certain foods that lower the function of the thyroid, which are known as goitrogenic foods, and depression. You may need medication, or may find a diet that eliminates goitrogenic foods can help the issue. To find out more about a thyroid supportive diet, you can read my article about the best and worst foods for your thyroid here: <a href="https://health.allwomenstalk.com/foods-to-avoid-for-hypothyroidism/">health.allwomenstalk.com</a>. </p><h2 id="2">2. Not Enough Calories</h2> <p>Many people who have a low thyroid have a sluggish metabolism, since our thyroid gland is responsible for boosting our metabolism to start with. Yet, even if your thyroid is working fine, your metabolism can still be slowing down for one reason you may have not considered, which is you might not be eating enough! If you’re on a diet and eating around 1200 calories, or worse, eating less, then you’ll most likely be tired a good bit of the time. When the body isn’t getting enough calories, the metabolism slows down and starts to eat your muscle for fuel. This is bad on a number of levels, and especially bad news for your energy levels. Your body usually needs more calories than you think, probably somewhere over the 2500 mark if you’re extremely active and at least 2000 a day if you’re moderately active. Feed your body so you can have the energy you need, and be sure to get your calories from whole foods instead of processed foods. To find out some great ways to boost your metabolism, try some of Neecey’s tips here: <a href="https://diet.allwomenstalk.com/natural-metabolism-boosters-that-work-100/">diet.allwomenstalk.com</a>. </p><h2 id="3">3. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h2> <p>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, also known as CFS, is one of the leading health issues affecting Americans today that has no permanent cure. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is in fact, one of the first things you should consider if you can’t seem to make it through the day without a nap, and are getting plenty of sleep. There is no known medical reason for CFS, but it is thought to be related to psychological stress, a poorly functioning immune system, hormonal problems, and/or a viral infection. Symptoms of CFS include loss of memory, inability to focus, a sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes or glands in the armpits, unexplained muscle pain, pain in the joints without swelling, constant headaches, unrefreshing sleep, and extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exercises. There is no medication to help with Chronic Fatigue Syndrom, but you should see your doctor to discuss any lifestyle changes that may help if you suspect this to be a reason of your fatigue. To see some of the best ways to keep your immune system in shape so you don’t develop CFS, check out Alison’s tips here: <a href="https://health.allwomenstalk.com/ways-to-boost-your-immune-system/">health.allwomenstalk.com</a>. </p><h2 id="4">4. Menopause</h2> <p>If you’re nearing the age for menopause, or haven’t had your period in at least six months to a year, then pre-menopause or menopause could be the reason you’re so tired all the time. Menopause is all about your hormones and your hormones directly affect your energy levels. If you believe this to be a concern and don’t have another reason to consider as the cause, see your OBGYN as soon as possible. </p><h2 id="5">5. Allergies</h2> <p>Many people are tired simply because they are suffering allergies, whether seasonal, or to pets, foods, mold, materials in certain fabrics, or even certain gases omitted in the air at places of employment, etc. Since allergic reactions can occur to so many things, you’ll need to investigate each area mentioned here to find out if one of these is a possible cause. An elimination diet can help with food allergies, and there are also some herbs you can take for seasonal allergies. If you suspect pets to be an issue, you can take over the counter meds that may help, and if you suspect mold to be a cause in your home, have someone do a mold inspection annually. To find out what you need to know about an elimination diet to prevent allergic reactions in foods, feel free to check out my tips here: <a href="https://health.allwomenstalk.com/basic-things-about-an-elimination-diet-you-need-to-know/">health.allwomenstalk.com</a>. </p><h2 id="6">6. Candida</h2> <p>Have you heard of candida? Candida albicanis is a systemic yeast that takes host in your digestive tract, yet can affect your entire body, and even the brain if it gets out of control. It feeds off a diet rich in sugars, refined foods and processed foods, along with a high glycemic diet. It can make you chronically ill and weaken your entire immune system, affecting your energy levels in the process. Candida isn’t a myth as some people believe, and should be addressed to ensure this isn’t the cause of your fatigue since it is highly treatable through natural remedies or even safe medications. If you’d like to find out how to prevent candida through your diet alone, or help remedy an ongoing infection, read my tips here: <a href="https://food.allwomenstalk.com/unique-foods-to-fight-off-candida-yeast-in-the-body-fast/">food.allwomenstalk.com</a>. </p><h2 id="7">7. Lupus</h2> <p>Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease, where the immune system thinks the body is being invaded and it creates autoantibodies to protect you. In the process these autoantibodies harm the tissues of the body which cause extreme pain, especially in the joints, along with fatigue, anemia and a feeling of having the flu all the time. Lupus is a serious disease and it should never be excluded out of possible reasons you may be so tired all the time. See your doctor immediately if you believe this to be a cause. There are lifestyle options and medications that can help and doctors can give you a test to determine if lupus is the cause of your fatigue so you can either rule it out or learn how to treat it. To find out more about lupus, feel free to visit the Lupus Organization website here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.lupus.org/">lupus.org</a>.  </p><p>Being tired all the time is no fun, but there are many possible reasons why that are also very easy to treat. Have you ever experienced extreme fatigue no matter how much sleep you get?  </p><p><strong>Sources:</strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.lupus.org/">webmd.com,</a> <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/PFYDjD">mayoclinic.com</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bodyecology.com/">bodyecology.com</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.lupus.org/">lupus.org</a> </p></body></html>
